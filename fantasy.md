Players make attacks.
  with melee weapons.
  with magic spells.
  healing is like attacks

Players also receive attacks.
  defended with armour
  defended with magic means
(clerics don't have defenses...)


Rooms have monsters
Rooms have treasure

Players have a set of defensive aspects.
Players have a set of attacks.


So we need a GameMaster.
  GameMaster manages attacks between Player v Player
  GameMaster manages attacks between Player v Monster

  Attacking player is told who they're attacking, and picks a weapon to return to the GameMaster
  Defending player is told who they're defending against, and picks a defense to use.
  GameMaster calculates battle result, and tells each side.
